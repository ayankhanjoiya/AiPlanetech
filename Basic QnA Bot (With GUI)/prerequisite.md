## **üìå Prerequisites for This Chatbot Project**

This project involves **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning (Keras), and GUI development (Tkinter)**. Before diving in, students should have a solid understanding of the following:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Python Basics**

- Variables, data types, loops, functions
- List, dictionaries, tuples
- File handling (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words (using `nltk.word_tokenize()`)
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root form (`nltk.WordNetLemmatizer()`)
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Converting sentences into numerical form
- **Text Preprocessing**: Lowercasing, removing stopwords, etc.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Learning with Keras**

- Understanding how a **Neural Network** works
- **Training vs. Inference**: The difference between training (`train_model.py`) and using a trained model (`chatbot_ui.py`)
- **Softmax Activation**: Used to predict intent probabilities
- **Saving and Loading Models** (`model.save()` and `load_model()`)

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Working with Data**

- **JSON Format**: Understanding intent-response structure in `admission_data.json`
- **Pickle Files** (`words.pkl`, `classes.pkl`): Serializing and loading Python objects
- **Handling missing/corrupt data**

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Tkinter (GUI Development)**

- **Creating Windows** (`tk.Tk()`)
- **Adding Widgets** (`Text`, `Button`, `Scrollbar`)
- **Event Handling** (`bind()` for key events)
- **Updating UI in real-time**

## **üõ† Recommended Learning Path**

### ‚úÖ **1\. Review Python Basics**

Students should be comfortable with:

- Functions, loops, and conditionals
- Lists and dictionaries
- File handling (`open()`, `json.load()`, `pickle.load()`)

### ‚úÖ **2\. Understand NLP Basics (Using NLTK)**

- Run small examples of **tokenization and lemmatization** before using them in the project.

### ‚úÖ **3\. Train a Simple Neural Network (Using Keras)**

- Train a basic **feedforward neural network** on a small dataset before training the chatbot model.

### ‚úÖ **4\. Work with JSON and Pickle Files**

- Show how JSON is structured (`key-value` pairs).
- Explain why we use **pickle** (to save and load lists quickly).

### ‚úÖ **5\. Build a Small Tkinter GUI**

- Create a basic **Tkinter chat window** without the chatbot logic.
- Make a simple **text entry + display output** to get comfortable with event handling.

## **üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues**

If you are facing errors, check:

1. **Model Not Loading Properly**

    - Ensure `chatbot_model.h5` exists and is trained.
    - Run `train_model.py` again if needed.

2. **Empty Predictions**

    - If `ints = []`, check `ERROR_THRESHOLD` in `predict_class()`.

3. **Unrecognized User Input**

    - Ensure `words.pkl` and `classes.pkl` are valid.
